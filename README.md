# Pygame Maze Solver
This repository contains a Python script that generates a maze using the Pygame library and provides functionality to solve the maze using a pathfinding algorithm.

# Features
1. Maze generation: The script generates a maze with a specified number of columns and rows using a randomized algorithm.
2. Maze solving: It implements a pathfinding algorithm to find and display the solution path from the start position to the end position in the maze.
3. Interactive gameplay: The user can navigate the maze using the arrow keys and control a player character represented by a colored rectangle.
4. Menu options: The script provides menu buttons to solve the maze automatically or reset it for a new challenge.
